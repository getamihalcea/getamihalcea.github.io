Optimizer
The Hypersistence Optimizer framework allows you to detect JPA and Hibernate mapping and configuration issues. Besides providing you a very detailed report about the issues found in your application, you can configure Hypersistence Optimizer to prevent the build from succeeding when a given performance issue is detected.

Check out the following video demonstration to get a better idea of how Hypersistence Optimizer can help you speed up your application.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/getamihalcea/getamihalcea.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
